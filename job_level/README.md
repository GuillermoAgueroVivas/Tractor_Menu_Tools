This repository contains all the tools I have created to be able to assist others utilizing the online Tractor interface. It is all divided by Job Level and Task Level according to what each tool does.

- **Job Level** means these tools would should show up in Tractor (after being added to the corresponding 'menus.config' file) when the user right-clicks on a Tractor Job.
- **Task Level** means these tools would should show up in Tractor when the user right-clicks on a Task within a Tractor Job.
